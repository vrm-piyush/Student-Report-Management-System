# Student Report Management System

## Goal
The goal of the Student Report Management System was to create a C++ program that allows users (teachers or administrators) to manage student records efficiently. \
It aimed to provide functionalities such as adding student details, displaying individual and class-wise results, modifying records, and deleting records from a binary file.

## Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, some challenges were encountered:
1. **File Handling:** Implementing file handling to store and retrieve student records in a binary file required careful handling of file operations and data serialization.
2. **User Interface:** Creating a user-friendly and intuitive menu-based interface was important to ensure ease of use for non-technical users.
3. **Data Validation:** Input validation was necessary to prevent invalid data from corrupting the records or causing runtime errors.
4. **Data Integrity:** Ensuring data integrity and consistency while updating or deleting records was crucial to avoid data loss or inconsistency.

## My Role
As an individual developer, my role in this project involved the entire lifecycle of the application:
1. **Requirement Analysis:** I analyzed the project requirements and identified the necessary functionalities to be implemented.
2. **Design:** I designed the class structure for the student entity and various member functions for different operations.
3. **Development:** I implemented the functionalities for adding, displaying, updating, and deleting student records, as well as the file handling operations.
4. **Testing:** I performed rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues in the program.
5. **User Experience:** I focused on providing a user-friendly interface and implemented input validation to ensure a smooth user experience.
6. **Documentation:** I documented the code and provided clear instructions on how to use the application.
